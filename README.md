# BNP_Paribas_Cardiff_Claim_Management
Project: Kaggle - BNP Paribas Cardiff Claims Management

Objective: This project attempts to automate personal insurance claim approval mechanism by means of using data intelligence.
Given a set of completely anonymous attributes we were to model the probability of a claim to be safely approved without 
needing any further manual scrutiny. We made extensive use of Bayesian/ Likelihood encoding of different order feature 
interactions to improve the predictive power of our model. We ended up adopting a three-layer ensemble architechtural design
for our final model.
